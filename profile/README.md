# Metal3 Community
Welcome to the Metal3 Community organization - a collaborative space for extending the Metal3 ecosystem to achieve complete bare metal cloud infrastructure.

The Metal3 Community organization exists to develop, maintain, and contribute extensions to the Metal3 project that bridge the gaps toward achieving a truly comprehensive bare metal cloud platform. While Metal3 provides excellent Kubernetes-native bare metal provisioning, real-world deployments often require additional tooling and capabilities that fall outside the core project's scope.

## Purpose

This organization serves as a community-driven hub for:

- Filling Infrastructure Gaps: Developing tools that address common bare metal cloud requirements not covered by core Metal3
- Integration Solutions: Creating bridges between Metal3 and other bare metal management ecosystems (OpenStack Ironic, vendor-specific BMCs, etc.)
- Enterprise Features: Building production-ready extensions that enhance Metal3's capabilities for enterprise deployments
- Community Innovation: Providing a space for experimental and specialized tools that extend Metal3's reach
